I want an app to copy my files from my phone, deduping automatically, to
a folder on my computer. It should also give me the option of naming them
individually, or en mass

1) get basic gui function with a few buttons

2) be able to push a button and copy file from phone to folder

2.5) look at drag and drop

3) dedupe these files

4) have option to rename them

5) have this open automatic when I plug my phone in
